# UAS-Coding-Challenge-2023
UBC UAS coding interview questions for the software team!

Note: 
- App.js contains my JS only for (F-RMT-0) it works, but I could not upload it to firebase.
- PascalsTriangle.js contains my solution for problem (F-PTR-0).
- I tried doing two to get myself more familiar with react and JS which I have used very little.

Thanks!
